This is NOT a release. This is NOT a beta. It isn't even an alpha. It's a
development snapshot.

There is no documentation. Use the source, Luke.

I run it under OS/2 Warp 4 and Apache 1.3.6, and compile it with EMX 0.9c,
your mileage may vary. I have also adapted it to run under Linux (Debian
potato unstable snapshot, GNU C++ 2.95.1). You'll need SMAPI to run it.

This stuff is released under the GNU GPL version 2.
